Define moment-to-moment polymorphic events and stateful objects.

Summary
-------

Stately is a simple package for defining synchronous, or asynchronous
events on a stateful object. Events have straightforward designs with
minimal performance impacts, and are distributed by traits to stateful
objects and their observers.
